## Service microservice

Explain your models and integration with the inventory
microservice, here.

## Sales microservice

The sales microservice allows for users to visualize and add customers, salespeople, and sales. A poller is used
to obtain automobile info from the inventory microservice and stored into the AutomobileVO model. This information
is used to help facilitate the completion of the forms.
